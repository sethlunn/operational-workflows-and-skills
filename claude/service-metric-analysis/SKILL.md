# Service Metric Analysis

Read [../../workflows/service-metric-analysis.md](../../workflows/service-metric-analysis.md) before starting.

Default to production unless the user explicitly asks for another environment.
Use fixed calendar windows for long-range history instead of trusting one giant scalar rollup.
